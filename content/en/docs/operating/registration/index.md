The user must then type a username for registration in the field under Enter your username as it is shown in

After inserting the requested information click on the reCAPTCHA button and read the privacy policy that is
visualized by clicking on Privacy Policy (see Figure 31) and tick the box to confirm you have read and agree
upon the policy as it is shown in Figure 32.

After completing the previous step click on the Register button that is shown in Figure 33.

In order to complete the registration, login to your mailbox: an email should be sent from the administrator,
