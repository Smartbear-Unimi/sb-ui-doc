## Description

The SMART BEAR Dashboard is a user-friendly graphical interface that has been designed for the clinicians
involved in SMART BEAR, including Medical Doctors, nurses, social workers etc, to perform their activities
throughout the project, including the registration and assessment of patients, creating the interventions and
performing the analytics.

The workflow to be followed in the project has inspired the use of the Dashboard, its functionalities and
infrastructure, therefore this guide cannot replace the SMART BEAR protocol. Nonetheless it aims to support
clinicians doing their tasks e.g. by showing them where they should go to register a patient, conduct the
baseline assessment or set the threshold values that trigger the interventions.
The Recruitment process is particularly stressed in this guide, because it includes the following steps:

1. Anagraphics
2. Assessment of Exclusion Criteria
3. General Assessment, including: medical history, physical examinations, life habits, medications and
diet supplements
4. Assessment of specific comorbidities
5. Device allocation [FAQ]({{< ref "/docs/help/faq.md" >}} "FAQ")

The Dashboard also provides functionalities to monitor the patients conditions, based on clinical data from
SMART BEAR, and also from the HOLOBalance and Smart4Health training.
