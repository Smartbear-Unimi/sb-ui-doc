# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are our answers to some of the most frequent problems and/or uncertainties users experience while navigating the dashboard. 

If our answer is not helpful, or you experience any new issue, please remember this page is maintained up to date with your suggestions. Therefore, feel free to contact our technical team.



## 1. Why do I see the risk of exclusion alert?

The risk of exclusion alert is shown when the profiling algorithm detects any element (e.g. Dexterity score, MoCA score etc.) which might hinder the patient in participating to the study. Anyway, if this orange alert pops up, do not panic, because the alert does not necessarily anticipate any particular risk for the patient's health. Instead, it is conceived for you as an invitation to carefully consider the pros and cons of enrolling a patient, and eventually make a decision, based on your experience by clicking on EXCLUDE, or DON'T EXCLUDE.


## 2. What do I have to do to activate a smart scale?

Follow the steps below:

1. Fill the Medical History, in particular do not forget the patient's weight
2. In the Device Management tab, create a new device and choose "smart scale". **If you cannot see the smart scale in the menu, it means the patient's profile does not support it.**
3. Pair the scale with the smartphone with the QR code
4. Ask the patient to step on the scale, without opening the app, wait for the display to turn off.
5. Open the Weight menu of the app.
