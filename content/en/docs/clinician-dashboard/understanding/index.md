## General Outline

The SMART BEAR Dashboard is the graphical interface for clinicians to insert and visualize data collected
from the daily activities of the patients participating to the project. The Dashboard data inserted come from
different sources including: the Baseline Assessment, the physiological parameters and activity-related data
transmitted from the devices, the responses to and scores of questionnaires. For an overview of the available pages and functionalities, see [Features]({{< ref "/docs/clinician-dashboard/features/index.md" >}} "Features").

Notably, the following functionalities are available:

1. A clinician can manage his/her patients during all the phases of the monitoring from the Baseline Assessment, through the data collection phase to the 6-months check-up visits (see [Patient Registration]({{< ref "/docs/operating/patient-registration/index.md" >}} "Patient Registration"), [Exclusion Criteria]({{< ref "/docs/operating/exclusion-criteria/index.md" >}} "Exclusion Criteria"), [Baseline Assessment]({{< ref "/docs/operating/baseline-assessment/index.md" >}} "Baseline Assessment")
[Patient Management]({{< ref "/docs/operating/patient-management/index.md" >}} "Patient management"))
2. Interventions can be created in the dedicated [Interventions]({{< ref "/docs/operating/interventions/index.md" >}} "Interventions")) page
3. Clinicians can receive notifications about the managed patients patients in the [Inbox]({{< ref "/docs/operating/inbox/index.md" >}} "Inbox")) page
4. The users can create and manage GDPR-related requests, for their patients in [GDPR]({{< ref "/docs/operating/gdpr/index.md" >}} "GDPR")).
