## General Outline

The SMART BEAR Dashboard is the graphical interface for clinicians to insert and visualize data collected
from the daily activities of the patients participating to the project. The Dashboard data inserted come from
different sources including: the Baseline Assessment, the physiological parameters and activity-related data
transmitted from the devices, the responses to and scores of questionnaires.

1. An overview of the Dashboard pages is provided in [Features]({{< ref "/docs/clinician-dashboard/features/index.md" >}} "Features")
2. An overview of the aggregated clinical data, including physiological parameters, responses to questionnaires, is shown in the Home page (see [Features]({{< ref "/docs/clinician-dashboard/features/index.md" >}} "Features"))
3. A clinician can manage his/her patients during all the phases of the monitoring from the Baseline Assessment, through the data collection phase to the 6-months check-up visits (see [Patient Registration]({{< ref "/docs/operating/patient-registration/index.md" >}} "Patient Registration"), [Exclusion Criteria]({{< ref "/docs/operating/exclusion-criteria/index.md" >}} "Exclusion Criteria"), [Baseline Assessment]({{< ref "/docs/operating/baseline-assessment/index.md" >}} "Baseline Assessment"),
[Patient Management]({{< ref "/docs/operating/patient-management/index.md" >}} "Patient management"))
4. Rule-based interventions for Cardiovascular diseases can be created (see [Interventions]({{< ref "/docs/operating/interventions/index.md" >}} "Interventions"))
5. Clinicians can receive notifications about the managed patients patients (see [Inbox]({{< ref "/docs/operating/inbox/index.md" >}} "Inbox"))
6. The users can create and manage GDPR-related requests, for their patients (see [GDPR]({{< ref "/docs/operating/gdpr/index.md" >}} "GDPR")).
