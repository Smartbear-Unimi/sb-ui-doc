The workflow to be followed in the project has inspired the use of the Dashboard, its functionalities and infrastructure, therefore this guide cannot replace the SMART BEAR protocol. Nonetheless it aims to support clinicians doing their tasks e.g. by showing them where they should go to register a patient, conduct the baseline assessment or set the threshold values that trigger the interventions. The Recruitment process is particularly stressed in this guide, because it includes the following steps:
Anagraphics Assessment of Exclusion Criteria General Assessment, including: medical history, physical examinations, life habits, medications and diet supplements Assessment of specific comorbidities Device allocation The Dashboard also provides functionalities to monitor the patients conditions, based on clinical data from SMART BEAR, the HOLOBalance and Smart4Health training.

1. Why do I see the risk of exclusion alert? #The risk of exclusion alert is shown when the profiling algorithm detects any element (e.g. Dexterity score, MoCA score etc.) which might hinder the patient in participating to the study. Anyway, if this orange alert pops up, do not panic, because the alert does not necessarily anticipate any particular risk for the patient\u0026rsquo;s health. Instead, it is conceived for you as an invitation to carefully consider the pros and cons of enrolling a patient, and eventually make a decision, based on your experience by clicking on EXCLUDE, or DON\u0026rsquo;T EXCLUDE.
2. What do I have to do to activate a smart scale? #Follow the steps below:
Fill the Medical History, in particular do not forget the patient\u0026rsquo;s weight In the Device Management tab, create a new device and choose \u0026ldquo;smart scale\u0026rdquo;. If you cannot see the smart scale in the menu, it means the patient\u0026rsquo;s profile does not support it.
