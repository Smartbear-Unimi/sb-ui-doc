The workflow to be followed in the project has inspired the use of the Dashboard, its functionalities and infrastructure, therefore this guide cannot replace the SMART BEAR protocol. Nonetheless it aims to support clinicians doing their tasks e.g. by showing them where they should go to register a patient, conduct the baseline assessment or set the threshold values that trigger the interventions. The Recruitment process is particularly stressed in this guide, because it includes the following steps:
Anagraphics Assessment of Exclusion Criteria General Assessment, including: medical history, physical examinations, life habits, medications and diet supplements Assessment of specific comorbidities Device allocation The Dashboard also provides functionalities to monitor the patients conditions, based on clinical data from SMART BEAR, and also from the HOLOBalance and Smart4Health training.
