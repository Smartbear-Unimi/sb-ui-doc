The SMART BEAR Dashboard is a user-friendly graphical interface that has been designed for the clinicians involved in SMART BEAR, including Medical Doctors, nurses, social workers etc, to perform their activities throughout the project, including the registration and assessment of patients, creating the interventions and performing the analytics.
The workflow to be followed in the project has inspired the use of the Dashboard, its functionalities and infrastructure, therefore this guide cannot replace the SMART BEAR protocol.</description></item></channel></rss>
