The workflow to be followed in the project has inspired the use of the Dashboard, its functionalities and infrastructure, therefore this guide cannot replace the SMART BEAR protocol. Nonetheless it aims to support clinicians doing their tasks e.g. by showing them where they should go to register a patient, conduct the baseline assessment or set the threshold values that trigger the interventions. The Recruitment process is particularly stressed in this guide, because it includes the following steps:
Anagraphics Assessment of Exclusion Criteria General Assessment, including: medical history, physical examinations, life habits, medications and diet supplements Assessment of specific comorbidities Device allocation The Dashboard also provides functionalities to monitor the patients conditions, based on clinical data from SMART BEAR, and also from the HOLOBalance and Smart4Health training.

Interventions Management #The Interventions are personalized messages that are delivered to a patient, according to the recorded value of his/her clinical data, and target specific comorbidities.

The work is ongoing on Machine Learning algorithms that will suggest values to adjust the thresholds, based on the pattern a data time series has been following during the monitoring. Click on INTERVENTIONS to open the Intervention tab. All the interventions are shown as a record in the tab, and can be deleted. Rule-based Interventions can be created and managed for a patient in the case of CVDs. The parameters of an Intervention for CVDs are the following:
